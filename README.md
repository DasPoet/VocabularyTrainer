This is a vocabulary trainer was made as an easy tool to help people learn new vocabulary.

- the END command: a breakpoint after which no further vocabulary is considered by the trainer
- the philosophy behind the END command is that progress should be linear; therefore, no specific ranges of words are
  eligible for selection in the editor
- characters like "ä", "ö", "ü" and "ß" are to be expressed as "ae", "oe", "ue" and "ss" respectively
